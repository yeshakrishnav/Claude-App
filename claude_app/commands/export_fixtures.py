Custom `8848-export-fixtures` bench command.

Location: apps/<app_name>/<app_name>/commands/export_fixtures.py
This is a copy-pasteable template — see project_base_template/commands/README.md
for the full setup steps and CLAUDE.md's `commands/` directory entry for where
it fits in the app structure. Reads fixture definitions from the app's own
`custom_fixtures` hook (not Frappe's built-in `fixtures` hook) and strips
null/empty/zero-valued fields before writing, keeping fixture JSON small and
diff-friendly. Registered via `commands = [...]` in this package's
`__init__.py`, then wired into `hooks.py`'s `commands` list — see
bench-operations.md.
